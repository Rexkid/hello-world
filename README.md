Getting to know GitHub

This is pretty cool! Although I am tired from working all day, I am going to program some lines of code to keep sharp. 
I also need to learn some new things.  After reviewing some new coding languages, I am digging learning multiple 
languages.  

I need to get one down with managing a DB though.
